## Mantine

Use Tailwind UI for layout and use free Mantine components

### Pros

- Various component options
- Structred docs
- Ready-to-use hooks
- Storybook
- Easy to customize
- Frequent update and bug fixes because the team uses it internally

### Cons

- can not apply tailwind css on Mantine components

### Experience

- RESPONSIVE: can set breakpoits in the theme and control components size with media
- SPACING: can set spacing in theme
- COLOR: it uses [open-color](https://yeun.github.io/open-color/) in default theme, each color has 10 shades
- CUSTOMIZE: can set modal not be closed by click outside using `closeOnClickOutside` prop
- THEME: can set theme color with `ColorSchemeProvider` in app
